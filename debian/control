Description: Standards-compliant WebSocket client and server
 This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the Faye
 project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and clients
 in Ruby. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it easy to
 handle WebSocket connections within an existing Rack application. It does not
 provide any abstraction other than the standard WebSocket API.
 .
 It also provides an abstraction for handling EventSource connections, which
 are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They
 are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies
 than WebSockets.
